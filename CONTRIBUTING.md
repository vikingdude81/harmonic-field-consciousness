# Contributing to Harmonic Field Consciousness

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  
This repository accompanies the paper *A Harmonic Field Model of Consciousness in the Human Brain*   
and provides reproducible code, figures, and LaTeX sources.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
If you find any bugs, inconsistencies, or areas needing clarification,  
please open an issue on GitHub with:
- a clear description of the problem  
- steps to reproduce (if applicable)  
- relevant code snippets or figure outputs  

### 2. Submitting Improvements
Pull requests (PRs) are welcome for:
- improving documentation  
- adding additional figure-generation examples  
- extending the harmonic simulation code  
- improving computational efficiency  
- adding optional real-data notebooks  

Before submitting a PR, please:
- make sure your code is clean and documented  
- ensure figures reproduce deterministically  
- test scripts in a fresh Python environment  

### 3. Project Philosophy
This repository is designed to be:
- clear  
- reproducible  
- accessible  
- useful to researchers across theoretical and computational neuroscience  

Please keep contributions aligned with these principles.
