🚀 A Harmonic Field Model of Consciousness in the Human Brain
Code, Figures, and Reproducible Materials

The paper presents a unified, mathematically grounded account of consciousness based on connectome harmonics, oscillatory gating, and mode-wide integration, resolving the long-standing delta paradox and integrating recent advances in population coding and mixed selectivity (MillerLab, 2024–2025).

This repository contains the full reproducible workflow:

Python scripts for generating all five figures

Synthetic harmonic-mode simulations

Example “brain graph” Laplacians

Consciousness functional evaluation (H_mode, PR, R(t), Ṡ, κ)

LaTeX source for the full manuscript

Optional extensions for real-data examples (EEG/MEG using MNE)

🔬 Reproducibility

All figures in the paper can be reproduced by running:

python code/generate_fig1_modes.py
python code/generate_fig2_states.py
python code/generate_fig3_functional.py
python code/generate_fig4_delta_paradox.py
python code/generate_fig5_gating.py


The scripts require only standard Python scientific libraries:

NumPy

SciPy

Matplotlib

NetworkX

(Optional real-data examples require mne).

🧠 About the Paper

The model formalizes consciousness as a global field configuration across the connectome:

The connectome Laplacian eigenmodes (ψₖ) form the natural harmonic basis.

Dynamics follow modewise second-order oscillators with nonlinear coupling.

Consciousness corresponds to a state with:

high harmonic richness

high mode participation ratio

high phase coherence

positive entropy production

a stable but metastable criticality index

This approach resolves the Delta Paradox by showing that frequency bands do not determine conscious state —
global field configuration and oscillatory gating do.

The framework is substrate-agnostic (biological, artificial, hybrid) and geometry-agnostic (any Laplace-type operator).
