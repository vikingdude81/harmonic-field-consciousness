# Category 4: Real-World Applications

This category applies the consciousness model to real-world scenarios.

## Experiments

### exp1_neural_networks.py
**Apply to artificial neural networks**

Procedure:
- Load simple CNN/transformer architecture
- Extract connectivity graph from weights
- Compute eigenmodes of neural network
- Compare across: untrained, trained, overtrained
- Measure "consciousness-like" properties
- Test different architectures (CNN, RNN, Transformer)
- Generate comparative analysis

**Output**: `results/exp1_neural_networks/`

### exp2_social_networks.py
**Test on social network graphs**

Procedure:
- Load example social network data (or generate with preferential attachment)
- Apply consciousness metrics to communities
- Test collective coordination measures
- Compare online vs offline networks
- Identify "conscious" vs "fragmented" communities
- Visualize social harmonic modes

**Output**: `results/exp2_social_networks/`

### exp3_psychedelic_states.py
**Model altered consciousness**

Procedure:
- Create psychedelic power distributions (enhanced high modes)
- Model psilocybin, LSD, DMT parameter spaces
- Compare to empirical fMRI entropy data
- Test "ego dissolution" as reduced low-mode dominance
- Generate psychedelic state visualizations
- Predict therapeutic windows

**Output**: `results/exp3_psychedelic_states/`

### exp4_anesthesia_depth.py
**Clinical anesthesia monitoring**

Procedure:
- Create continuous anesthesia depth spectrum
- Model propofol, sevoflurane effects
- Correlate C(t) with clinical depth scales (BIS, Ramsay)
- Test prediction of awareness during surgery
- Generate depth monitoring dashboard
- Real-time simulation

**Output**: `results/exp4_anesthesia_depth/`
